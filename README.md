## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
- [1] Snapchat: Pinning best friends on top of chat, using filters, exploring stories
- [2] Tiktok: Sending videos to friends, adding music to your videos, follow creators
- [3] BeReal: Posting double-sided photo, getting notification when to post, reacting to other posts with selfies
- [4] Spotify: Browse through different genres, add favorite songs to a playlist, use the miniplayer displayed on lockscreen
 

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
One challenge I faced was connecting the button to the action function, I reread
the procedure and fixed it.
